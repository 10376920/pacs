Function for Runge Kutta adaptive time integration.
For scalar ODE of the form dy/dt = f(y,t), on the time domain [0 100].

make will create the executable.
make clean will clean executable and objects.
make distclean will clean result.dat too.

./main will start the program, and will ask the user to choose the step method between two schemes.
Otherwise, you can specify the desired step function by command line:
./main rk23 (or RK23)
./main rk45 (or RK45)

The program asks the user to type the righ-hand function f(y,t) and the initial value y(0).
Results are stored in result.dat.
After the computation is done, you are allowed to type the exact solution, if you know its expression, so that the error can be evaluated.

bash plot.sh uses gnuplot to shot the result

NOTES ON INSTALLATION:
The program uses the muparser library. If the library is installed in your pacs/Examples/lib directory, you may have to add this path to the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH. (e.g. LD_LIBRARY_PATH+=";/home/pacs_student/Documents/pacs/Examples/lib")
